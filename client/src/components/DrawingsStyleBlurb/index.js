            <p>One line drawing is a continuous line, and remains unbroken from beginning to
            endâ€”an uninterrupted process, in its contact with the surface of the paper.

            While the drawing seems to take particular thought and care, the margin of error creates an original, nuanced artwork. Often times, the unplanned dialectically contributes to work, a process that bridges technique with randomness.
